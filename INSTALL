INSTALLATION - Manual

Step 1:  Back up your glFusion Database.  The dailyquote plugin adds tables 
to your glFusion database. You can do this with the built in admin backup 
facility.

Step 2:  Uncompress the dailyquote plugin archive while in the 
<glfusion_private_dir>/plugins directory.  The archive will create a 
directory called dailyquote in the plugins directory.

Step 3:  Create the public_html and admin directories.  Under your html 
directory (usually public_html) create a directory called dailyquote.  
Under your admin/plugins/ directory create a directory called dailyquote.

Step 4:  Change to your <glfusion_private_dir>/plugins/dailyquote/ directory.
Copy the files in the admin directory to the admin/plugins/dailyquote/ 
directory your created in step 3.  Copy the files and directories in the 
public_html directory to the public_html/dailyquote/ directory you created 
in step 3.

Step 5:  Log in to your glFusion as a root user, chose Plugins from Admin 
Block. You will see the new plugin awaiting installation. Click Install. 
The install page will tell you if the install was successful or not.  If not 
examine glFusion system error log for possible problems.

The dailyquote plugin should now be installed and functioning.  Clicking on 
the dailyquote Icon will take you to the admin page.  Visit the site 
Configuration section to set system options for the plugin.
