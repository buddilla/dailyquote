1.0.5 IE fix
	* fixed a browser compatablility issue that caused wide displays
	due to the float property not rendering correctly in IE--applies
	to singlequote.thtml.
	* fixed another IE compatablility issue causing a wide display
	on the batch add page--agian.
1.0.4 to 1.0.5
	* fixed a number of small bugs with the new category mgmt page
	as well as the page nav on the search page.  A few other bugs 
	that crept in (as reported in the 1.0.4 thread at geeklog.net)
	were also squashed.
	* fixed the install failure that was due to missing table values
	in the install routine.  This error was due to power failures and
	lost data.
	* changed the bracketed number beside the admin link to display
	the number of quotes in the queue rather than the total number of
	quotes in the system.
	* added a dailyquote menu block to the left blocks.  What links
	would usually show up in the link row atop the plugin's pages,
	now show up in the menu block--if you have GL 1.3.10 or later.  
	Earlier	versions than 1.3.10 should leave the link row intact.
	* truncated the display length of quotes (64 chars) and quoted
	(24 chars) in the results returned by the GL search engine.
	* added "last 10 posts by..." and "total number of..." support so
	these values will show up on a user's profile display page.
	NOTE: to implement this feature, you will need to mod the GL core--
	read the usage doc to find out how and why.
	* added the ability to backup your dailyquote database tables from
	the admin page.  You can preview, download, restore, and/or delete
	the backup from this page as well.  NOTE: trust at your own risk--
	still being developed.
	* renamed and moved the /tmp directory to public_html/dailyquote/data.
	This was to accomodate the database backup downloads that I didn't
	want in the geeklog path.  This change means that upgrading will
	involve creating that new directory and making it writable.
	/tmp will no longer be used. (rc1: testing the batch add would be a
	good idea here, thanks)
	* rewrote the category management form to allow updating/deleting of
	more than one category at a time.  Changed the form display getting
	rid of some of the button clutter.
	* rewrote the update logic for the cat man page in its entirety.
	why? cuz it sucked.
1.0.3 to 1.0.4
	* various changes were made to the database--run the update script 
	and don't forget to replace the table prefix if you have changed your 
	default.  If you are only upgrading from 1.0.4rc1, only apply the 
	sql statements as marked in the update script file.
	* added a database check utility--available from the admin page.
	This will check	for orphaned entries in the DQ tables.
	* added a title field to the add form, etc.
	* added source and title search types to the search form.
	* added an edit button to the regular listings and to the search
	results--available for admin.  This link shoots you to the manage
	page with the relevant quote ready for editing.
	* added a category management page allowing you to create, edit, or
	delete/delete all categories.  You can also enable or disable/disable
	all categories from this page.
	* enabled the display limit on the search page.  This is configurable
	from the admin page.
	* made the permission to add categories configurable from the admin
	page--applies to logged in members from add.php (add2.php and manage.php
	assumes	greater responsilbility and so add cat is available to any who
	have access to those pages).
	* cleaned up the category listings in the add and manage forms--only
	noticable if you have plenty of categories.
	* made the google link configurable from the admin page.  Now you can
	turn it on/off.
	* fixed a problem with the phpblock add link permissions.
	* fixed the search 'limit by category' malfunction that crept in at 1.0.3.
	* cleaned up some more generic code here and there.
	* alphabetized the english language file.
	* applied some suggestions--only minor code mods.
	* replaced the default link images with cleaner ones--easier to edit.
	To use the images, uncomment lines in functions.inc>linkrow().
1.0.2 to 1.0.3
	* various changes were made to the database--run the update script 
	and don't forget to replace the table prefix if you have changed your 
	default.
	* added a category index page allowing you to view quotations 
	according to category without having to build a search query.
	The category index links now build your query for you.
	* a number of typos fixed in the language file.
	* added source and source date fields to the add form, etc.
	* added all quote related info to the "blocks" as configurable 
	components that can be turned on or off from the admin page: e.g., if 
	you want to see the contributor's name and/or the source date, etc., you 
	have only to turn these components on in the admin page.  This applies 
	to the centerblock, the phpblock, as well as the standard random 
	quote box.
	* made the contributor's name clickable to GeekLog's profile page.
	* google-linked the name of the personality quoted.
	* made the categories clickable to the search page listing all 
	quotes in that category.
	* corrected a SQL error that was being returned when searching for 
	whitespace.  Applies only to search.php.
	* corrected the return of double the proper categories for a quote after 
	updating the contributor's name from the manage page.
	* manage page now refreshes with the same search parameters after updating
	or deleting an entry.
1.0 to 1.0.2
	* added a field to the setting table--run the update script and don't 
	forget to replace the table prefix if you have changed your default.
	* added a contributor by-line to the phpblock and fixed the one in the 
	centerblock, which didn't supply a contributor name when calling a 
	cached quote.  Uncomment lines 674-676 and lines 690-692 in functions.inc
	if you wish to use this feature in the phpblock.  For the same function
	in the centerblock, uncomment the appropriate HTML (line 8) in centerblock.thtml
	* fixed a bug in moderate.php where delete statement syntax had an error 
	making it impossible to delete a quotation while it was yet in the queue.
	* added instructions to the single quotation add page with regard to double 
	quotation marks.
