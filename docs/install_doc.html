<li><strong><a name="1">Introduction</a></strong>
This is the DailyQuote plugin using the GL Plugin API calls--some of them.
It's most basic function displays a random quote in a PHP block or a center block.
It is configurable to deliver much more functionality than simply displaying a
random quote, e.g.: quotes may be cached; quotes may be searched and displayed;
quote submissions may be moderated; permissions are configurable; and more.  See the 
<a href="usage.html">usage.html</a> doc in the &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/plugins/dailyquote/docs.</li>

<li><strong><a name="2">License</a></strong>
This GeekLog Plug-in, like GeekLog is released under the 
GNU General Public License. It is a bona fide Open Source / Free Software project.
Like all good open source projects, GeekLog and this Plug-in both depend on the 
community. Thanks for your continued support, and let us know what we can do to 
make GeekLog and the plugin even better.</li>

<li><strong><a name="3">Installation</a></strong>
It is recommended that you read and reference the Plugin Installation Overview documentation 
located on the GeekLog Documentation Project site. There is a lot more detail on 
how to install plugins including annotated images.

The Plugin installation requires that you manually create the plugin program directories
and copy the program files into their appropriate directories.

	<ol>
	<li><strong>Database backup</strong><br />
	Make a backup of your current GeekLog database using the 
	built-in admin feature. Verify your backup feature is configured correctly and 
	backup file is not 0 bytes (This is worth a check)</li>

	<li><strong>Copy plugin files</strong> into their required directories<br />
	- Need to create these directories as noted below:<br />
	uncompress the archive files into your &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/plugins 
	directory. It will create a dailyquote/ directory and associated subdirectories
	for the files. You will need to move the files in the admin and public subdirectories
	to their appropriate directory as indicated below.

		<ol>
		<li>public_html/<br />
			- Main program files<br />
		The files in the public directory under your new plugins/dailyquote/ folder need
		to be moved to &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/public_html/dailyquote/ directory.  You will need to
		first create the:  &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/public_html/dailyquote/ directory.</li>
		<li>admin/<br />
			-Plugin Install and Main admin program files<br />
		The files in the admin directory under your new	plugins/dailyquote/ folder need to be
		moved to &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/public_html/admin/plugins/dailyquote/ directory.  You will need
		to first create the:  &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/public_html/admin/plugins/dailyquote/ directory.</li>
		<li>Directory and File Permissions<br />
		Directory and File owner should be same as web server<br />
		All the files and directories should have Read permissions and directories need 
		execute. Setting all plugin files and directories to have read + execute should 
		not be a security issue but PHP files only need read access to execute. The 
		directories need execute rights in order for them to be searched or accessed.<br />
		The data/ dir, &lt;pubilc_html&gt;/dailyquote/data/, must be writable if you intend
		to use the batch add function.</li></ol></li>

	<li><strong>Run the install program</strong><br />

		<ol>
		<li>Logged in as admin<br />
		In your browser, go to http://your_geeklog_url/admin/plugins/dailyquote/install.php<br />
		Note: The installer is designed to back out any database changes if there should be an error.
		You can monitor the installer by viewing the error.log, file &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/logs/error.log.</li>
		<li>Verify successful operation<br />
		Did you get a successful completion message that your database tables have been created--this 
		message is found in your error log.<br />
		There should now be a DailyQuote link in your top header.  If not, refresh the page.<br />
		As admin, you should see the DailyQuote menu item in the Admin Block.</li>
		<li>Check the install logging in the &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/logs/error.log file</li>
		<li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">One last step</span>:<br />
		You should now see a &lt;public_html&gt;/dailyquote/data/ directory.  This directory must be 
		made writable if you are going to add quotations using the batch add function or if you plan 
		on using the database backup utility.  If you do not see this directory then it will have to 
		be created.</li>
		<li>To make use of the extended user's profile, read the &quot;Profile Display Integration&quot; 
		section of usage.html.</li>
		</ol></li></ol></li>
<li><strong><a name="4">Upgrade</a></strong>:

	<ul>
	<li>If you are <strong>upgrading from 1.0.5rc1</strong>, you need only to replace your files.  No database changes were 
	made.</li>
	<li>If you are <strong>upgrading to 1.0.5</strong>, you need to create a new directory named &lt;data/&gt; under 
	your &lt;public_html&gt;/dailyquote/ directory and make it writable.  This dir will now be the temp 
	directory for the batch add function as well as the directory responsible for housing the database 
	backups. the &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/plugins/dailyquote/tmp/ directory is no longer necessary and can 
	be deleted.  To make use of the extended user's profile, read the upgrade section of usage.html.</li>
	<li>If you are <strong>upgrading from 1.0.4</strong> to 1.0.5, be aware of one database change making it necessary 
	to run the update script found in &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/plugins/dailyquote/updates/.  A number of files 
	have been changed so you'll need to copy those over your old files remembering to take note of custom
	changes that you have made so those changes can be reapplied.</li>
	<li>If you are <strong>upgrading from any other version</strong> to 1.0.5, be sure to apply all relevant update scripts 
	in the proper order.  All update scripts are found in &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/plugins/dailyquote/updates/.  
	A number of files have been changed so you'll need to copy those over your old files remembering to take 
	note of custom changes that you have made so those changes can be reapplied.</li>
	<li>See the change.log for changes.  There is no list of changed files.</li>
	<!--<li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Important Note</span>:<br />
	Be advised that when you apply the latest update script, it will effectively enable all categories.  
	These can easily be disabled again using the category management page, which is new to 1.0.4.</li> -->
	</ul></li>

<li><strong><a name="5">Uninstall</a></strong>:

	<ol>
	<li>Go to Admin Block/Plugins<br />
	Find the plugin in the list of plugins, click the number, then press Delete, confirm (or not)
	deletion, this will remove all the plugin data from your database.</li>
	<li>Delete the three plugin directories created in the install process:  <geeklog-dir>plugins/dailyquote/;
	&lt;public_html&gt;/dailyquote/; and <admin>/plugins/dailyquote/.</li></ol>

</li></ol>
